# Trevor's dotfiles

This repository just serves as a central repository for the various dotfiles that I use on pretty much all of my *nix machines.

## Installation

Clone down the repository:

```bash
$> git clone git@github.com:T99/dotfiles.git
Cloning into 'dotfiles'...
[...]
```

Navigate into the directory that you've just cloned the repository into:

```bash
$> cd dotfiles
```

Ensure that the `install` file is executable:

```bash
$> chmod +x install
```

And run the `install` file!

```bash
$> ./install
[...]
```

Don't worry, the install script is interactive, and will ask before overwriting any existing dotfiles that might already be in-place.
